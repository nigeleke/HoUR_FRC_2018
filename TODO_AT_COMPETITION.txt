1. Understand how the Game Data will be communicated to the Drive Station. Will the entries in the Drive Station be ignored.?

2. Check Grabber direction for Grab/Release go in direction expected by operator - as per Gabe's last minute change pre-packaged robot.

3. Do DriveStraight autonomous to check distance - re-record if not far enough, then overwrite DriveStraight.dat file in src folder - and rebuild.

4. Record a PushCube (only) autonomous sequence - then overwrite PushCube.dat file in src folder - and rebuild.

5. Record a RaiseLift (only) autonomous sequence - then overwrite RaiseLift.dat file in src folder - and rebuild.

6. Check that the limit switch code works (in particular the LiftDown and LiftUp. Ethan's Note: The logic of these Limit Switches make no sense)

7. Ensure Lift does not have to be raised for any Switch sequences
